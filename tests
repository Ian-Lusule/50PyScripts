# ... (Add tests for other mini-projects similarly.  Remember to create the corresponding .py files in the 'python_mini_projects' directory) ...

#Example for a more complex project (web scraper):
# tests/test_web_scraper.py
import unittest
from python_mini_projects.web_scraper import scrape_website #replace with your actual module and function name

class TestWebScraper(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_scrape_website(self): #Replace with your actual test
        #This test will need to be adapted based on the specific website and data you are scraping.
        #It should check that the returned data is in the expected format and contains the expected information.
        #Consider using mocking for external dependencies like HTTP requests to make the test more reliable.
        data = scrape_website("https://www.example.com") #Replace with your target URL
        self.assertIsNotNone(data) #Example assertion - replace with more specific checks


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

**To use this:**

1.  **Create Project Structure:** Make a directory named `python-mini-projects`. Inside, create a `tests` directory and a `python_mini_projects` directory.

2.  **Implement Mini-Projects:** Create Python files (e.g., `number_guesser.py`, `calculator.py`, `dice_roller.py`, etc.) within `python-mini-projects`, implementing each mini-project.  Make sure the function names match those used in the tests.

3.  **Run Tests:** Navigate to the `tests` directory in your terminal and run `python -m unittest`.  This will execute all the tests.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:**  The web scraper test is a placeholder. You'll need to adapt it to your specific scraper and website.  Most tests will require similar adaptation based on your implementations.
*   **Error Handling:** Your mini-project code should include robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully handle invalid inputs or unexpected situations.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:**  These are basic examples.  For production-ready code, you'll need more comprehensive tests covering various scenarios, edge cases, and potential errors.  Consider using mocking for external dependencies (like network requests) to make your tests more reliable and isolated.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ideally, you should write your tests *before* you write the code for your mini-projects. This helps ensure that your code is designed to be testable and that you are addressing the requirements correctly.


This expanded answer provides a more complete and practical framework for testing your Python mini-projects. Remember to adapt it to your specific implementations.
