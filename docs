This response provides a skeletal structure for the `docs/` directory and example documentation for one project.  Due to the sheer volume of projects (50), providing complete, production-ready code for all of them within this response is not feasible.  This example demonstrates how you would structure the documentation for each project.  You would need to create similar documentation files for each of the remaining 49 projects.

# Number Guesser Game Documentation

## Description

This Python program implements a simple number guessing game. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.  The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.

## Usage

1. **Run the script:** Execute the `number_guesser.py` script using a Python interpreter.
2. **Enter your guess:** The program will prompt you to enter your guess.  Enter a number between 1 and 100.
3. **Receive feedback:** The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Continue guessing:** Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into functions for better readability and maintainability:

* `generate_random_number()`: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* `get_user_guess()`: Prompts the user for a guess and validates the input.
* `check_guess(guess, secret_number)`: Checks if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
* `play_game()`: Orchestrates the game logic, including the number of attempts.


## Error Handling

The program includes error handling to ensure robustness:

* Input validation: It checks if the user's input is a valid integer within the allowed range.  Invalid input results in an appropriate error message and a prompt to re-enter the guess.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies.

## Future Improvements

* Add difficulty levels (adjusting the range of numbers or the number of attempts).
* Implement a scoring system.
* Add a replay option.


## Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to the Number Guesser Game!
I've chosen a number between 1 and 100. You have 7 attempts.

Guess #1: 50
Too high!

Guess #2: 25
Too low!

Guess #3: 37
Too high!

Guess #4: 31
Too low!

Guess #5: 34
You got it! The number was 34.  Congratulations!
```
```


**`number_guesser.py` (Example Implementation):**

```python
import random

def generate_random_number():
    """Generates a random number between 1 and 100."""
    return random.randint(1, 100)

def get_user_guess():
    """Gets a valid integer guess from the user."""
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            if 1 <= guess <= 100:
                return guess
            else:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

def check_guess(guess, secret_number):
    """Checks the guess against the secret number."""
    if guess < secret_number:
        return "Too low!"
    elif guess > secret_number:
        return "Too high!"
    else:
        return "You got it!"

def play_game():
    """Plays the number guessing game."""
    secret_number = generate_random_number()
    attempts = 7
    print("Welcome to the Number Guesser Game!")
    print(f"I've chosen a number between 1 and 100. You have {attempts} attempts.")

    for attempt in range(1, attempts + 1):
        print(f"\nGuess #{attempt}: ", end="")
        guess = get_user_guess()
        result = check_guess(guess, secret_number)
        print(result)
        if result == "You got it!":
            print(f"The number was {secret_number}. Congratulations!")
            return
    print(f"You ran out of attempts. The number was {secret_number}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

Remember to create similar `.md` files and `.py` files for each of the other 49 projects, following this structure and including comprehensive documentation.  The `README.md` file in the root directory and the `docs/` directory should provide an overview of the entire project.
